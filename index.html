    <p class="list-group-item-text col-lg-7 col-md-7 col-sm-7 col-xs-12">Playing is also important other 
      than stuides. Our school uses this information strictly. We had a football field, basketball court and a 
      indoor sports room. Now we also got a cricket area to play cricket. The ground is made out of fine grass
      and a normal soft pitch. We have almost all the ascessories for a cricket match. It is kind a big area
      because our school doesn't make any problems in playing. We usually would have 3-5 pe periods a week.</p>

    <p class="list-group-item-text col-lg-7 col-md-7 col-sm-7 col-xs-12">We started the NEW ATTENDENCE SYSTEM.The 
      3 step attendence system to make sure whether their child reaches the school and attends the class. We 
     firstly lets the students inside the school the closes the gates, so that they can't skip class, also we 
     have big walls.Secondly,We will take the attendence of every period for eg: when the 1st period starts we 
     will take the attendence, the same for all periods.Thridly,We will send all the attendence in the school list-group
      so that the parents know whether they were present or not.
